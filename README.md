# m.e.i.n.e.l.
The **M**odern, **E**xtensible and **I**nteractive **N**umber **E**xploration **L**ibrary (or short: m.e.i.n.e.l.) is a visualization library for data gathered trough Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).
It focuses on abstracting the interfaces in a way that one only needs to supply the data and few (optional) parameters to embed visually appealing charts into existing environments.
